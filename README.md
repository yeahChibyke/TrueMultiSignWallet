The `TrueMultiSignWallet` contract ensures that funds can only be moved out of the wallet or significant actions taken when a predefined number of the wallet's true owners agree to it. This is done through a multi-step process where a transaction is first submitted, then confirmed by multiple true owners, and finally executed. This process enhances security and provides a decentralized decision-making mechanism for managing the wallet's funds.
